This React component utilizes the `useEffect` hook incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior. The cleanup function within `useEffect` is not properly handling asynchronous operations, specifically a timeout. When the component unmounts, the timeout might not be cleared promptly, causing potential errors or memory leaks.
